# Head tag
This is just like heading when you are writing a paragraph for anything.
The heading can have different size that's why the heading tag has subtags like
- H1 `<h1></h1>` <h1>head tag 1st</h1>
- H2 `<h2></h2>` <h2>head tag 2nd</h2>
- H3 `<h3></h3>` <h3>head tag 3rd</h3>
- H4 `<h4></h4>` <h4>head tag 4rth</h4>
- H5 `<h5></h5>` <h5>head tag fifth</h5>
- H6 `<h6></h6>` <h6>head tag sixth</h6>
